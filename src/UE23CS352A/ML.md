# UE23CS352A: Machine Learning

> Machine Learning surrounds us today: in phones that respond to voice commands, programs that beat humans at Chess and Go, robots that assist surgeries, vehicles that drive in urban traffic, and systems that recommend products to customers on e-commerce platforms. This course aims to familiarize students with the breadth of modern ML, to impart an understanding of the dramatic surge of ML in the last decade, and to foster an appreciation for the distinctive role that ML can play in shaping the future of our society. This course requires the student to have a desirable knowledge of Statistics for Data Science, Linear Algebra and its Applications and Design and Analysis of Algorithms.

## Course Objectives

- Formulate a well-defined Machine Learning problem with clear metrics.
- Understand the notions of Hypotheses Space, Hypotheses Structure and Search.
- Become conversant with types of Machine Learning Algorithms, their applicability and Inductive Bias.
- Familiarize with techniques for Ensemble Learning and deep learning.

## Course Outcomes

- Distinguish categories of Data Attributes, Dimensions, and Sample Sizes.
- Acquire a thorough understanding of Supervised, Unsupervised Learning,
- Apply Ensemble Methods and deep learning methods for solving the problems.
- Design and implement a solution to real world machine learning problem.
