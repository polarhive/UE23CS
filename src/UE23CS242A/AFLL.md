# UE23CS242A: Automata Formal Languages and Logic

> The course introduces fundamental concepts in Automata and Formal Languages and their application to Logic. The course covers the notions of Finite State Automaton, Regular expression, Push down Automaton, Context Free Languages and Turing Machines. These abstract and formal models and their usage in Propositional and First Order Predicate Logic, allow for solving problems in Formal language Generation and Recognition.

## Course Objectives

- Teach students to construct basic machines like DFA, NFA which represent Regular Languages, Regular Expressions, and Regular Grammars and to identify Non – Regular Languages.
- To familiarize students to construct Teach students to identify Context Free Languages, to construct Push down Automata which represent Context Free Languages, to convert the given grammar to various normal forms and to make use of Membership Algorithm.
- Teach students to understand closure properties of Context Free Languages, to identify Non – Context Free Languages and to construct Turing Machines and
- To familiarize students with concepts like Recursively Enumerable languages, Recursive Languages, Undecidable Problems. And to familiarize notions of mathematical logic: logical notations (syntax) and how to assign meaning to them (semantics).

## Course Outcomes

- Design simple machines like DFA, NFA, convert NFA to DFA and minimize a given DFA, construct regular expressions for different languages, verify that some languages are regular and some are not.
- Analyze the difference between Regular Languages and Context Free Languages, design Push Down automata,construct Context Free Grammars, and convert one form of the grammar to another form.
- Enumerate the properties of Context Free Grammars, verify that some languages are context free and some are not, design Turing Machines, and analyze the difference between acceptability and decidability
- Analyze the difference between Recursive and Recursively Enumerable Languages, Decidable Languages,Turing – Recognizable and Co – Turing – Recognizable, some problems that cannot be solved by Turing Machines, reduce one Undesirables Problem to another, Undeniable Problems for Recursively Enumerable Languages. And make use of Propositional Logic and Predicate Logic in knowledge representation and truth verification.
