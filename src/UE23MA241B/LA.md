# UE23MA241B: Linear Algebra

> This is a basic subject on matrix theory and linear algebra. Emphasis is given to topics that will be useful in computer science discipline, including systems of equations, vector spaces, eigenvalues, similarity, and positive definite matrices. The course provides hands-on experience in basic programming concepts using Python/R for solving problems relevant to these areas.

## Course Objectives

- The first goal of the course is to teach students how to use linear algebra as a powerful tool for computation.
- The second goal is to show how these computations can be conceptualized in a geometric framework.
- The third goal is to give a gentle introduction to the theory of abstract vector spaces.
- To visualize solution to linear system of equations with different approaches using Python.

## Course Outcomes

- Solve systems of Linear Equations using Matrix Transformations, Interpret the nature of Solutions, Visualize Consistency of Linear system of Equations and also compute inverse of a Matrix.
-  Demonstrate the ability to work within Vector Spaces, distil Vector Space properties and understand the concepts of the four fundamental Subspaces, Linear Span, Linear Independence, Dimension and Basis
- Learn the concepts of Orthogonal Vectors and Orthogonal Subspaces and apply the Gram-Schmidt process to find an Orthonormal Basis in a Subspace, Eigenvalues, Eigenvectors and Diagonalization of a Matrix.
- Apply the concept of Positive Definite Matrices, Singular Value Decomposition into Application problems.
