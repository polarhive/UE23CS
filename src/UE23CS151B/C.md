# UE23CS151B: Problem Solving with C

In Problem Solving with C Course, will be learning to solve common types of computational problems, by analyzing the given problem statement and developing an algorithm to solve the given problem. Then make use of C language constructs to develop well-structured programs.

## Course objectives

- Acquire knowledge on how to solve relevant and logical problems using computing machine
- Map algorithmic solutions to relevant features of C programming language constructs
- Gain knowledge about C constructs and its associated eco-system
- Appreciate and gain knowledge about the issues with C Standards and its respective behaviours
- Get insights about testing and debugging C Programs

## Course outcomes

At the end of the course, the student will be able to

- Understand and apply algorithmic solutions to counting problems using appropriate C Constructs
- Understand, analyse and apply text processing and string manipulation methods using C Arrays, Pointers and functions
- Understand prioritized scheduling and implement the same using C structures
- Understand and apply sorting techniques using advanced C constructs
- Understand and evaluate portable programming techniques using preprocessor directives and conditional
compilation of C Programs
