# UE23CS342AA3: IoT

# Intro to IoT

The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of physical devices, vehicles, appliances, and other physical objects that are embedded with sensors, software, and network connectivity, allowing them to collect and share data.

- Connectivity: The IoT relies on the ability of physical objects to connect to the internet. This is made possible by the use of low-power, wide-area networks (LPWANs) such as Sigfox, LoRaWAN, and NB-IoT.
- Sensing: IoT devices are typically equipped with sensors that collect data about the environment. This data can be used to monitor conditions, track movement, and detect events.
- Communication: IoT devices need to be able to communicate with each other and with the cloud. This is typically done using standard protocols such as MQTT, CoAP, and HTTP.
- Analytics: The data collected by IoT devices can be analyzed to gain insights into the physical world. This data can be used to improve efficiency, optimize processes, and make better decisions.

## Connectivity

Connectivity refers to the various communication technologies and protocols that enable Internet of Things (IoT) devices to connect, communicate, and exchange data with other devices, networks, or cloud platforms.

# Security & Privacy Risks

oT devices often lack robust security features, making them vulnerable entry points in a network. Examples of Threats: - Default credentials left unchanged by users - Insecure communication (unencrypted data transfer) - Firmware vulnerabilities left unpatched - Botnets (e.g., Mirai attack) using IoT devices for DDoS Impact: - Compromised personal data - Unauthorized control of devices (e.g., smart locks, health monitors) - Loss of trust in IoT solutions

## Lack of Interoperability & Standards

- There is no universally accepted protocol or standard for IoT. - Devices from different vendors often cannot communicate with each other. Examples: - One device uses MQTT, another uses CoAP, a third uses proprietary APIs - Compatibility issues with cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) Impact: - Increased integration complexity - Vendor lock-in and increased system fragmentation - Difficulty scaling IoT solutions across ecosystems

## Connectivity & Network Reliability

IoT devices rely heavily on continuous, stable internet or wireless connectivity, which isn’t always available—especially in rural or remote environments. Issues: - Packet loss and latency - Power outages or signal interference - Choice of protocol (Wi-Fi vs. LoRa vs. Zigbee vs. NB-IoT) Impact: - Loss of real-time capabilities - Missed alerts or incorrect data readings - Poor user experience and system unreliability

## Power Management

- Most IoT devices (especially sensors) are battery-operated and deployed in hard-to-reach places. Challenges: - Frequent recharging/replacement is impractical - Always-on connectivity drains battery - Trade-off between data transmission frequency and battery life Impact: - Shortened device lifetime - Maintenance overhead and increased costs - Reduced efficiency in long-term deployments

### Data Overload & Management

- IoT ecosystems generate massive volumes of data continuously, much of which is redundant or noisy. Challenges: - Real-time processing vs. long-term storage - Data filtering, deduplication, and compression - Ensuring data integrity and time synchronization Impact: - Cloud and network resource strain - Decision-making delays - Increased need for edge computing and AI analytics

### Scalability Bottlenecks

- Expanding from a few devices to thousands requires rethinking system architecture, data pipelines, and compute power. Challenges: - Load balancing and throughput handling - Device provisioning and lifecycle management - Ensuring performance doesn’t degrade at scale Impact: - Increased cloud and infrastructure costs - Complexity in system orchestration and updates - Need for robust device management platforms

---

# IoT Architecture

- IoT architecture is the structure enabling internet-connected devices to communicate with other devices. - IoT architecture refers to the many ways that IoT devices are structured to meet user needs. - Most IoT architecture models include 3 to 7 sets of functional components, or “layers”, such as perception (e.g., sensors), transport (e.g., Wi-Fi), and application (e.g., software) layers. - Notably, IoT architecture lacks standardized protocols, raising compatibility, security, and other challenges.

oT Architectural Drivers - A driver is a core influencing factor or requirement that shapes the way an IoT system is designed and built. - These are not physical components but rather forces, goals, or constraints—technical, economic, or user-based—that push the architecture in a specific direction. - For example, if low latency is important, the architecture must include edge computing

## Scalability

- Scalability is the ability of an IoT system to handle increasing loads—such as more devices, more users, more data, or more concurrent operations—without a drop in performance, reliability, or manageability. - IoT systems often begin small (e.g., 10 sensors) but can scale to thousands or even millions. A rigid architecture collapses under this expansion

![[Screenshot 2025-08-29 at 12.31.54.png]]

### Architectural Impact of Scalability

To achieve scalability, IoT architectures must include:

1. Cloud-Native Infrastructure
	1. Leverage platforms like AWS IoT, Azure IoT Hub, or GCP IoT Core.
	2. Elastic scaling (auto-scaling compute/storage resources).
2. Microservices Architecture
	1. Break down functionality into independent, reusable services.
	2. Each service (e.g., device registry, data ingestion, alerting) can scale on demand.
3. Message Queuing and Streaming
	1. Use brokers like MQTT, Apache Kafka, or RabbitMQ.
	2. Decouples data producers (devices) from consumers (apps/services), allowing independent scaling.
4. Horizontal Scaling
	1. Add more machines/nodes to handle load, instead of upgrading a single machine (vertical scaling).
	2. Used in load-balanced gateways, API servers, databases.
5. Data Lake or Distributed Databases
	1. Use scalable storage systems like Amazon S3, HDFS, or NoSQL databases like MongoDB, Cassandra.
	2. Handles massive data growth across time

## Latency Sensitivity

- Latency sensitivity refers to how critically a system or application is affected by delays in data transmission, processing, or response time. - In IoT, latency-sensitive applications require near-instantaneous reactions to sensor inputs or events. - In simpler terms, latency is the time taken for data to travel from a device to the server and back. If a delay causes functional failure, it’s latency-sensitive

Latency sensitivity shapes architecture significantly: 1. Edge Computing - Data is processed near the source (e.g., at the gateway or sensor). - Reduces dependency on distant cloud servers. - Enables real-time response even if cloud is unreachable. 2. Low-Latency Protocols - Prefer lightweight, fast protocols like MQTT, CoAP, or UDP over HTTP. - Minimize handshake overhead and data payload size. 3. Local Decision-Making - Use onboard ML models (TinyML) for immediate inference. - Example: A drone avoids obstacles using onboard logic, not cloud ML.

## Types of Intelligence in IoT

## Security & Privacy

Security in IoT refers to protecting devices, networks, and data from unauthorized access, attacks, tampering, and data breaches. - Privacy in IoT refers to protecting personal, sensitive, or identifiable information collected from devices against misuse, leakage, or unauthorized processing.

IoT environments are: - Highly distributed (millions of endpoints) - Resource-constrained (limited memory, compute, battery) - Often unattended (deployed in open/public spaces) - Always online (exposed to remote attacks) - One vulnerable device can compromise an entire system. - A hacked smart thermostat, for example, can be used to breach a home Wi-Fi network or take part in a DDoS attack (like the Mirai botnet incident in 2016)

![[Screenshot 2025-08-29 at 12.41.15.png]]

## Interoperability & Standards in IoT Architecture

- Interoperability in IoT refers to the ability of devices, platforms, applications, and systems from different vendors to work together seamlessly, exchange data, and operate as a unified system. - Standards are the agreed-upon technical rules, formats, and protocols that enable interoperability by ensuring consistency across devices and systems

![[Screenshot 2025-08-29 at 12.41.51.png]]

# Simplified IoT Architecture & The Core IoT Functional Stack

The Core IoT Functional Stack is presented in three layers, allowing for better visibility into the functions of each layer.

- Things (Sensors and Actuators): Physical devices that collect data (sensors) or interact with the environment (actuators).
- Communications Network: Transfers data between devices, gateways, and cloud systems using technologies like LoRa, FAN, PLC, and IP-based transport.
- Applications: End-user services and business logic that make use of IoT data (e.g., smart home apps, SCADA, MDM systems).

## Things Layer

At this level, the physical devices must conform to the limitations of the environment in which they are deployed, while also being capable of delivering the required information. - There are numerous ways to classify smart objects.

## Communications Network Layer

The cases where smart devices lack self-sufficiency, they must establish communication with an external system. Typically, this communication employs wireless technology. There are four sublayers in this layer.

### Access network sublayer

The access network is the final segment of the IoT network. This is commonly composed of wireless technologies such as 802.11ah, 802.15.4g, and LoRa. The sensors linked to the access network may also be connected via physical cables.

### Gateways and Backhaul network sublayer

It refers to the specific layer inside a network that handles the transmission of data between other networks and the main network infrastructure. A typical communication system arranges numerous intelligent things inside a specific region, all connected to a central gateway.

### The network transport sublayer

Is responsible for ensuring successful communication by implementing network and transport layer protocols, such as IP and UDP. These protocols facilitate the connection of various devices and the use of different media. - The IoT network management sublayer: It requires the implementation of additional protocols to enable the transmission of data between the headend apps and the sensors. Some examples of communication protocols are CoAP and MQTT.

## Application and Analytics Layer

At the higher layer, an application is responsible for processing the gathered data.

Its role is not only to control the smart objects as needed, but also to make intelligent decisions based on the collected information. These decisions are then used to instruct the "things" or other systems to adapt to the analyzed conditions and modify their behaviors or parameters. The subsequent sections analyze these components and assist you in designing an IoT communication network.

# IoT Data Management and Compute Stack

- The IoT Data Management and Compute Stack refers to the layered system of technologies and processes used to collect, store, process, analyze, and act upon data generated by IoT devices. - It defines where and how data is handled — from the moment it's sensed by a device to the moment it's used in decision-making or automation.

This stack handles where and how data is processed and stored across the system:

- Edge: Data is processed locally at or near the device to enable fast response (e.g., traffic control, industrial robots).
- Fog: Acts as an intermediate layer (between edge and cloud), supporting localized storage and analytics closer to the source.
- Cloud: Centralized computing and storage, suitable for complex analytics, dashboards, and long-term data management

## Edge Computing Layer

Location: Closest to the IoT devices (sensors & actuators). Examples: Embedded processors, smart cameras, industrial controllers.

- Ultra-low latency: Enables real-time or near-real-time decision-making.
- Local processing: Data is processed at the source (e.g., machine or sensor node).
- Bandwidth efficiency: Only relevant/aggregated data is sent upstream (to fog/cloud).
- Device autonomy: Edge nodes can continue operating even with network disruptions.

## Fog Computing Layer Location

Between edge and cloud, usually at the LAN level. Examples: Edge gateways, micro data centers, routers with compute

- Intermediate analytics: Aggregates and pre-processes data from multiple edge devices.
- Contextual decision-making: Supports site-level intelligence.
- Reduced latency vs cloud: Faster than cloud, though slower than edge.
- Orchestration point: Manages devices and ensures security, reliability, and failover.

## Cloud Computing Layer

Location: Remote data centers or public/private clouds. Examples: AWS IoT Core, Microsoft Azure IoT Hub, Google Cloud IoT.

- Massive scalability: Stores petabytes of data from global IoT devices.
- Advanced analytics: Enables AI/ML, deep learning, and predictive maintenance
- Centralized dashboards: For visualization, reporting, control. - Data fusion and integration: Integrates with ERP, CRM, and external systems

# MEMS

> Micro-Electro-Mechnaical Systems

Miniaturized mechanical and electro-mechanical elements (sensors, actuators, structures) fabricated using microfabrication. Combines mechanical, electrical, and sometimes fluidic components on a chip.

## Smart Objects – Sensor + Actuator Smart Object

A device that both senses and acts autonomously. They are what transform everyday objects into a network of intelligent objects that are able to learn from and interact with their environment in a meaningful way.

A smart object integrates sensors, a microprocessor, wireless communication interfaces (e.g., WiFi, Bluetooth, RFID), and embedded applications. - It analyses its environment through sensors that measure parameters like temperature, motion, speed, light, and humidity. The collected data is transmitted to servers via wireless networks.

![[Screenshot 2025-09-12 at 11.02.56.png]]

### Core Capabilities of a Smart Object

- Unique identity (identifier/name/address)
- Sensing: perceives ambient conditions (temperature, pressure, etc.)
- Processing: microcontroller or CPU + memory
- Communication: wired/wireless interface; network addressability
- Actuation & logic: executes pre‑programmed application logic to act/respond

### Classification by Behavior — Two Categories

1. Mobility
	1. Static objects: fixed installation (e.g. structural sensor, thermostat)
	2. Mobile objects: attached to moving entities or portable devices (e.g. wearables, asset tracker)
2. Reporting Frequency
	1. Low reporting: infrequent transmissions (e.g. a rust sensor sending monthly data)
	2. High reporting: rapid, frequent updates (e.g. motion/machine vibration sensors at hundreds Hz)

### Advantages

# Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs)

A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is a collection of small, autonomous, low-power sensor nodes that monitor physical or environmental conditions and wirelessly transmit data to a base station (also called a gateway or sink).

These networks are a critical component of the IoT ecosystem for applications like smart cities, industrial automation, agriculture, and environmental monitoring. Each sensor node typically includes:

- Sensor(s): To collect data (e.g., temperature, humidity, motion).
- Microcontroller: For data processing and control logic.
- Radio transceiver: To send and receive data.
- Battery or energy harvester: For power supply

## Communication patterns

- Event-driven: Transmission of sensory information is triggered only when a smart object detects a particular event or predetermined threshold.
- Periodic: Transmission of sensory information occurs only at periodic intervals

## Characteristics

- Low power and compute constraints – designed for long battery life.
- Self-organizing – nodes can form ad hoc mesh or tree topologies.
- Unattended operation – once deployed, nodes often work independently for long periods.

## Challenges

- Power management – nodes must optimize energy use for longevity.
- Reliability & coverage – ensuring consistent data transmission in dynamic environments.
- Scalability – supporting thousands of sensor nodes without congestion.
 - Security – lightweight encryption and authentication are critical due to limited resources.

# Embedded Programming STM32

Embedded programming involves writing software that runs on microcontrollers: small, dedicated computers inside everyday devices (e.g. washing machines, drones, cars).

Unlike general-purpose computers, embedded systems are:

- Designed for specific tasks
- Run in real-time
- Have limited memory and compute power
- Often lack an operating system or use a real-time OS (RTOS)

> [!Example]
>
> STM32 is a family of 32-bit ARM Cortex-M based microcontrollers by STMicroelectronics. They are: Low-power, high-performance, Have a wide range of built-in peripherals (ADC, UART, SPI, I2C). Supported by a rich development ecosystem

## Core Hardware Components of STM32

- Cortex-M CPU Core – processes instructions
- Flash Memory – stores firmware
- SRAM – runtime memory (variables, stack)
- GPIO – controls LEDs, buttons, etc.
- Timers – for precise time-based tasks
- ADC – reads analog voltages
- USART/I2C/SPI – for communication with external devices

> Core HW Features Hardware FPU & DSP based Instructions. Advanced Timer System (with Quadrature Encoder Interface). CAN, CAN-FD, USB OTG , Ethernet etc. Mixed-Signal Integration with built in OP - AMPS

## Toolchain

## GPIO

GPIO stands for General Purpose Input Output

- Control LEDs, buttons, sensors
- Pin modes: Input, Output, Alternate Function, Analog

```c
HAL_GPIO_TogglePin(GPIOC, GPIO_PIN_13); // Toggle LED 
HAL_Delay(500); // 500ms delay
```

Configure the LED pin as Output in `CubeMX`. In main.c, toggle pin with:

- `HAL_GPIO_TogglePin()`
- Add delay using `HAL_Delay()`

## UART = Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter

- Used for: Debugging via serial console (e.g., USB/COM)
- Communicating with modules (GPS, Bluetooth, etc.)

```c
char msg[] = "Hello \r\n";
HAL_UART_Transmit(&huart2, (uint8_t*)msg,  strlen(msg), HAL_MAX_DELAY);
```

## Communication Criteria in IoT

When designing or selecting connectivity options (wired or wireless) in an IoT system, engineers must assess various communication criteria to choose the most appropriate technology.

- Range
- Frequency Bands
- Power Consumption
- Topology
- Constrained Devices
- Constrained-Node Networks

Bandwidth refers to the amount of data that can be transmitted over a communication channel per unit of time, typically measured in bits per second (bps).

### Relevance

High-bandwidth networks are needed for transmitting rich data (e.g., images, video, firmware)

> Low-bandwidth networks are sufficient for small data like sensor readings. Example: Ethernet: High bandwidth. Zigbee: Low bandwidth.

### Latency

The delay between sending a signal and receiving the response or result. Measured in milliseconds (ms).

Importance: Real-time systems (e.g., autonomous cars, robotic arms) need very low latency. For non-critical updates (e.g., weekly reports), higher latency is acceptable. Example: Industrial motion controllers: require latency <10 ms. Smart agriculture soil data: tolerates 2–5 seconds delay

### Range

The maximum physical distance over which a communication signal can be transmitted while maintaining signal integrity.

Importance: Determines the physical layout of devices. Affects the cost and topology of deployment (e.g., mesh vs star).

> Example: • Zigbee: ~10–100 meters indoors. • LoRaWAN: Up to 10–15 km in rural areas.

### Power Consumption

The amount of electrical power a communication module uses during operation. Measured in milliwatts (mW) or joules per bit. Importance: • Critical for battery-powered and energy-harvesting IoT nodes. • High power usage = frequent charging or larger batteries. ☞ Example: • BLE: Low power for fitness bands. • Wi-Fi: High power, suited for plugged-in devices

### Scalability

Scalability refers to the system’s ability to handle increasing numbers of connected devices or nodes without performance degradation. ☞ Importance: • Smart homes may have 20–50 devices. • Smart cities may connect thousands of sensors. ☞ Example: • Zigbee: Supports large mesh networks. • RS-232: Point-to-point, not scalable.

### Reliability

The consistency and dependability of a communication channel to deliver messages without data loss or corruption. ☞ Importance: • Critical in safety-critical and industrial automation systems. ☞ Example: • Ethernet and RS-485 offer highly reliable communication. • Wi-Fi may drop packets in congested areas.

### Security

Security includes confidentiality, integrity, and authentication of data and devices in communication. ☞ Importance: • IoT systems often handle sensitive data (e.g., medical, financial). • Wireless channels are more vulnerable to eavesdropping and attacks. ☞ Example: • HTTPS over Wi-Fi. • AES encryption in Zigbee/LoRaWAN.
