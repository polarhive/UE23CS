# UE23CS151A: Python for Computational Problem Solving

Python is an easy to learn, general-purpose, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.

## Course Objectives

- Learn the syntax and semantics of Python programming language.
- Illustrate the process of structuring the data using lists, tuples, sets and dictionaries.
- Demonstrate the use of built-in functions to navigate the file system.
- Learn various paradigms of programming and implement the Object Oriented Programming concepts in Python.

## Course Outcomes

At the end of this course students will be able to,

- Program effectively using the Python language.
- Identify the methods to create and manipulate lists, tuples and dictionaries.
- Discover commonly used operations involving file system.
- Think using different paradigms of programming and interpret the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming as used in Python.
