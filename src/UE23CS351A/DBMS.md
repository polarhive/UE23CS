# UE23CS351A: Database Management System

> This course offers a solid theoretical foundation in Database Management System (DBMS) and explores the practical applications of DBMS in a real-world scenario. The course emphasizes on the creation and the design of relational database systems. It also introduces the databases that provides flexible schemas and scale easily with large amounts of data and high user loads.

## Course Objectives

- Understand fundamental concepts, terminology, and application of relational databases and Construct ER diagrams for a desired application and transform the same into a relational schema
- Understand database design concepts and design relational databases and construct basic and advanced SQL queries
- Understand, and apply Normal Forms in database design, Transactions, Concurrency control, Locking, and Recovery, implement them in a real-time setup, and transform the given Normal Form into the desired form.
- Understand the concepts of Database Security, and NoSQL databases such as MongoDB, Neo4j, and DynamoDB

## Course Outcomes

- Demonstrate an ability to explain the basic concepts of database management, construct and transform ER diagrams into Relational Schema.
- Design databases and construct simple and advanced SQL queries for given contexts.
- Explain Normal Forms, employ them in Database Design, and apply database security concepts in application contexts.
- Demonstrate the ability to use semi structured and NoSQL databases
