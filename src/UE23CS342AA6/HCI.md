# UE23CS342AA6: Human Computer Interaction

> This course provides an overview and introduction to the field of human-computer interaction, with an emphasis on what HCI methods and HCI-trained specialists can bring to design and development teams for all kinds of products. The course will introduce students to tools and techniques for creating or improving user interfaces.

## Course Objectives

- Get familiar with the psychology underlying user-interface and usability design guidelines keeping in mind human behavioral and perceptual capabilities and limitations that affect interface design.
- Get familiar with the basic principles of goal-directed user interface design and standard patterns and key modeling concepts involved in visual interface design for software interfaces.
- Aware of development methodologies and life cycle models for building user interfaces and prototyping in user interface design and how to test them.
- Get insights with the impact of usable interfaces in the acceptance and performance utilization of information systems.

## Course Outcomes

- Develop and incorporate a Conceptual Vocabulary for analyzing Human Interaction with software affordance, conceptual model and feedback.
- Interpret and Exemplify how User-Centered design complements other software process models. Apply low fidelity (lo-fi) prototyping techniques to gather and report user responses.
- Analyze and Define a User-Centered design process that explicitly takes into account the fact that the user is not from the Ecosystem of the Developer.
- Evaluate and Pick appropriate methods to support the development of a specific UI.
