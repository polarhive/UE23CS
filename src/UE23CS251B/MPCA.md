# UE23CS251B: Microprocessor and Computer Architecture

> This course will give you an in-depth understanding of the inner-workings of modern digital computer systems and trade-offs present at the hardware-software interface. The course focuses on key topics in microprocessor such as the system architecture, low level programming aspects and interface with other key components. Also, the course will help in understanding the core computer architecture concepts such as multilevel in memory hierarchies, pipelining, and super scalar techniques. A desirable knowledge of Digital Design and Computer organization is required.

## Course Objectives

- Introduce concepts of basic processor architecture and its design.
- Understanding the concept of concepts of pipeline architecture and hazards.
- Study of memory hierarchy, cache memory and its optimizations.
- Introduce advanced concepts in processor architecture like multi-core/ many core processor architectures.

## Course Outcomes

At the end of the course, the student will be able to:

- Demonstrate ability to understand the design of different instruction sets like RISC/ CISC and their addressing modes.
- Demonstrate the ability to understand the design of a pipelined processor and its challenges.
- Demonstrate the use of tools to analyse the performance of programs on different architectures. Design alternative memory hierarchy layouts and optimizations.
- Demonstrate and appreciate modern trends in architecture such as multicore architectures.
