# Engineering Optimization

## Optimization in Statistics

Optimization is a fundamental aspect of engineering that involves finding the best solution from a set of feasible alternatives. In engineering, optimization techniques are used to enhance the performance, efficiency, and reliability of systems and processes while minimizing costs, resources, and time.

The goal is to achieve the best possible outcome while adhering to constraints and requirements specific to the engineering domain.

### Network Routing

Network Routing can be formulated as a Constrained Optimization.

## Problem PCB design

Determine the optimal placement of components on a PCB to minimize the overall length of the connections (wires) between them, while ensuring that the layout meets certain constraints, such as avoiding overlaps, respecting component sizes, and adhering to manufacturing limitations.
