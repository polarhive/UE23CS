    "# Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make decisions about population parameters based on sample data. It involves assessing the validity of a hypothesis regarding a population mean, denoted as \\( \\mu \\). For example, the statement “\\( \\mu > 11 \\)” is a hypothesis about the population mean \\( \\mu \\). To determine how certain we can be that such a hypothesis is true, we must perform a hypothesis test.\n",
    "\n",
    "A hypothesis test produces a number between 0 and 1 that measures the degree of certainty we may have in the truth of a hypothesis about a quantity, such as a population mean. \n",
    "\n",
    "In most situations, the **null hypothesis (H₀)** states that the observed effect is due only to random variation between the sample and the population. In contrast, the **alternative hypothesis (H₁)** claims that the observed effect is real and accurately represents the whole population.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Hypothesis Tests\n",
    "- **Z-Test**\n",
    "- **One-Sample T-Test**\n",
    "- **Two-Sample T-Test**\n",
    "- **Paired T-Test**\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice between a Z-test and a T-test primarily depends on two factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sample Size**:\n",
    "   - **Z-Test**: Used when the sample size is large (usually \\( n >= 30 \\)).\n",
    "   - **T-Test**: More appropriate for small samples (typically \\( n < 30 \\)).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Population Standard Deviation**:\n",
    "   - **Z-Test**: Requires knowledge of the population standard deviation.\n",
    "   - **T-Test**: Used when the population standard deviation is unknown, which is common in real-world scenarios.\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "In hypothesis testing, we start with two hypotheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: The statement representing no effect or no difference in the population.\n",
    "2. **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: The statement we accept if the null hypothesis is rejected, indicating an effect or a difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Significance Level (α)**: The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. Common values are **0.05** or **0.01**.\n",
    "- **P-Value**: measures the plausibility of H0.The smaller the P-value, the stronger the evidence is against H0\n",
    "- **Critical Value**: The value that the test statistic must exceed to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to perform Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **State the Hypotheses**: Define both the null and alternative hypotheses.\n",
    "2. **Select a Significance Level (α)**: Typically, we use a level of **0.05**.\n",
    "3. **Choose an Appropriate Test**: Select the test based on data characteristics and assumptions.\n",
    "4. **Calculate the Test Statistic**: Perform calculations based on the test chosen.\n",
    "5. **Determine the P-Value or Critical Value**: Compare against the significance level.\n",
    "6. **Make a Decision**: If the p-value is less than α, reject the null hypothesis.\n"

    "A Z-test is typically used when the sample size is large and the population variance is known. It allows us to test if there is a significant difference between a sample statistic (like a mean) and a known population parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: The sample mean is equal to the population mean (no difference).\n",
