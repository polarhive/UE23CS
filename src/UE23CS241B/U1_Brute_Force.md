# Algorithms. Brute. Force

> Set of sequence of unambiguous instructions for solving a problem.

## Characteristics

1. Zero or more inputs: "hello world" program zero inputs
2. Definiteness: Each step should be precise and unambiguous
3. Output: At least one output
4. Effectiveness: Each step should be precise and feasible
5. Finiteness: Terminates after finite number of steps

> We write algorithms in pseudo-code: A mix of natural and programming language

```c
# Example: swap two numbers (a, b)
Algorithm swap(a,b)
Begin:
	temp = a;
	a = b;
	b = temp;
End:
```

> We can use `{}` in the place of `Begin:` and `End:`
> The = token may also be written as := and <-

# Ways to Analyse

1. Time Efficiency/Complexity: how long to run as `input` size grows
2. Space Efficiency/Complexity: how much memory consumed as `input` size grows
3. Network Efficiency/Complexity
4. Hardware (Power) Efficiency/Complexity

## Analyse Time and Space for

> [!Example]
>
> Time: measure every statement as 1 unit of time
> Space: Frequency count of variables when algorithms are small
>
> ```c
> Algorithm swap(a,b)
> Begin:
> 	temp <- a; (1t)
> 	a <- b;    (1t)
> 	b <- temp; (1t)
> End:
> ```

- T(n) = 1+1+1 = 3 = *constant*
- S(n) = 1+1+1 = 3 = constant

> We can represent this in the order of $O(1)$

> [!Example]
> Notice the difference when we have a loop:
> ```c
> Algorithm sum(A,n)
> Begin:
> 	s=0;
> 	for (i=0, i<n, i++)  // checks upto 'n+1' times, i++ 'n' times
> 		s = s + A[i]   // repeats upto n times
> 	return s;
> End:
> ```

1. The dominant term is checking the condition (n+1). Consider only this
2. (2n+2) -> n+1; the +2 becomes insignificant as n increases

> So: T(n+1) -> O(n)

# Algorithmic Analysis Framework

## 1. Space Complexity

> S(p) = C + SP(I)

- P is the problem
- C is the constants
- I talks about instance characteristics

## 2. Time Complexity

Big O, Step Count Method

## 3. Measuring Input Size

Efficiency of the algorithm -> func

- t(n) = n
- S(n) parameters a function takes

## 4. Measuring Run Time

- Identify the basic operation
- Understand the concept of basic operation
- Compute total time taken for the operation

> T(n) is Cop x C(n)

## 5. Compute the Order of Growth

Measure the performance of the algorithm in relation with input size, we must analyze for all cases of `n`

# Asymptotic Notation

> Asymptotic notations describe the growth of functions, often used in analyzing the time and space complexity of algorithms.

## Upper Bound

Big O provides the upper bound of an algorithm's running time, guaranteeing it won't exceed a certain rate of growth.

> [!Info]
> The function $( t(n) = O(g(n)) )$ if and only if there exist constants $( C > 0 )$ and $( n_0 \geq 0 )$ such that: $[ t(n) \leq C \cdot g(n), \quad \forall n \geq n_0 ]$

> Example: $( t(n) = 3n + 2 )$ is $( O(n) )$, as $( t(n) \leq 4n )$ for $( n \geq 1 )$ (with $( C = 4, n_0 = 1 )$).

---

## Lower Bound

Omega provides the lower bound of an algorithm's running time, guaranteeing it takes at least a certain amount of time.

> [!Info]
>
> The function $( t(n) = \Omega(g(n)) )$ if and only if there exist constants $( C > 0 )$ and $( n_0 \geq 0 )$ such that: $[ t(n) \geq C \cdot g(n), \quad \forall n \geq n_0 ]$

> Example: $( t(n) = 3n + 2 )$ is $( \Omega(n) )$, as $( t(n) \geq 3n )$ for $( n \geq 1 )$ (with $( C = 3, n_0 = 1 )$)

---

## Tight Bound

Theta provides both the upper and lower bounds, tightly bounding the growth of an algorithm's running time.

> [!Info]
> The function $( t(n) = \Theta(g(n)) )$ if and only if there exist constants $( C_1, C_2 > 0 )$ and $( n_0 \geq 0 )$ such that: $[ C_1 \cdot g(n) \leq t(n) \leq C_2 \cdot g(n), \quad \forall n \geq n_0 ]$

> Example: $( t(n) = 3n + 2 )$ is $( \Theta(n) )$, as $( 3n \leq t(n) \leq 4n )$ for $( n \geq 1 )$.

## Small o and Small Ï‰

> These notations describe stricter bounds compared to Big O and Omega.

| Notation     | Description        | Usage                           |
| ------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| $(O)$        | Upper bound        | Guarantees worst-case runtime   |
| $( \Omega )$ | Lower bound        | Guarantees minimum runtime      |
| $( \Theta )$ | Tight bound        | Represents average-case runtime |
| $( o )$      | Strict upper bound | Stricter than Big O             |
| $( \omega )$ | Strict lower bound | Stricter than Omega             |
