# **Reflection Questions & Answers**

**1. Did your estimations reflect the actual effort?**
Yes, most estimations matched the effort. A few tasks like loyalty points took slightly longer, but the Fibonacci points gave a good balance.

**2. Was your backlog well-prioritized?**
Yes, core features like ordering and payment were done first, while receipts, loyalty, and admin tasks were kept for Sprint 2.

**3. How did your simulated sprint align with your plan?**
Both sprints followed the plan well. Sprint 1 delivered the basic flow, and Sprint 2 added enhancements and admin features.

**4. What insights did the burndown chart give about your team’s capacity?**
The burndown chart showed realistic capacity. Sprint 1 finished slightly early, and Sprint 2 was steady, suggesting the team can handle about 18–21 points per sprint.
