# UE23CS341A: Software Engineering

> Software Engineering course deals with the Software development life cycles, their individual phases, principles, methods, procedures and tools associated. This also deals with making of choices, implications of making choices and exposes students to the Software eco-system which will be experienced by students in a post college environment.

## Course Objectives

- Learn Software Engineering concepts. Ensure the relevance and need of an engineering approach to software development.
- Expose students to the software project management and Life Cycles.
- Enable the students to understand the principles of Software Configuration Management and importance of software quality for Software Product Development.
- Enable students to understand the continuous development, build, test and release of software products.

## Course Outcomes

- Relate to the challenges of Software Development and Software Engineering as a methodical approach for development.
- Able to Use Software project management ideas and apply suitable architecture and design approaches for software development
- Able to implement Software Configuration Management principles and evaluate software quality using quality metrics
- Work on a project plan, track and manage projects to Understand the connectivity of the development process to operations, and relate to the DevOps activities.
