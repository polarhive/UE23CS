# UE23CS343AB2: Big Data

> The course introduces various Big Data technologies that are used to analyze large amounts of data either in batch mode or streaming mode. It focuses on both processing and storage technologies and looks at how algorithms need to be modified to work with large amounts of data. This course requires the student to have a desirable knowledge of [[DSA|Data Structures and its Applications]] and [[DAA|Design and Analysis of Algorithm]].

## Course Objectives

- Provide an introduction to Big Data technologies.
- Introduce computational and storage technologies for Big Data Ecosystem.
- Introduce algorithms for processing Big Data and programming tools focusing on practical issues in working with Big Data.
- Learn application of Big Data techniques to various real-life problems.

## Course Outcomes

- Explore various characteristics of Big Data Problems.
- Evaluate principles and design alternative computational/storage technologies for Big Data.
- Design Big Data applications using available infrastructure for Big Data through practical assignments.
- Applying Big Data techniques in real life problems through a group-based project.
