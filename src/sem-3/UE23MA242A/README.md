# UE23MA242A: Mathematics for Computer Science Engineers

> Data Science is the study of data. It is about extracting, analyzing, visualizing, managing, and storing data to create insights. This course covers both Descriptive statistics to understand the data and the inferential statistics which seeks to infer something about a population on the basis of a statistical sample and build a simple linear regression model.

### Course Objectives:

- Provide insights about the basic roles of a Data Scientist. Develop a greater understanding of the importance of Data Visualization techniques.
- Provide students with knowledge of Random Variables and their Distributions.
- Provide students with knowledge of Confidence Intervals and their importance. Make inferences about the opulation parameters using sample data and test it to draw meaningful conclusions.
- Provide an understanding on the importance and techniques of predicting a relationship between the two sets of data and determine the goodness of fit model.

### Course Outcomes:

- Use Python and other tools to extract, clean and analyze data from several data sources (files, web) analyze an extremely large datset and perform exploratory data analysis to extract meaningful insights.
- Analyze a real-world problem and solve the same with the knowledge gained from various distribution studies.
- Compute Confidence Intervals.
- Develop and test a hypothesis about the population parameters to draw meaningful conclusions and fit a regression model to data and use it for prediction.
