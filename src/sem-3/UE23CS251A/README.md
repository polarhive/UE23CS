# UE23CS251A: Digital Design and Computer Organization

> This course focuses on the structure, design and operation of a computer system at different levels of abstraction. The digital design part of the course describes low level digital logic building blocks while the computer organization part explains the structure and operation of microprocessors.

### Course Objectives:
- Fundamental (combinational and sequential) building blocks of digital logic circuits.
- Design of more complex logic circuits such as **adders, multipliers and register files**.
- Design of **Finite State Machines** based on problem specification.
- Construction, using above logic circuits, of a microprocessor and its functioning at the clock cycle level.
### Course Outcomes:
- Perform analysis of given synchronous digital logic circuit.
- Design and implement small to medium scale data path logic circuits from given specification.
- Design and implement control logic using Finite State Machines.
- Understand hardware level microprocessor operation, providing a foundation for the higher layers and utilize the concepts and techniques learnt to implement complex digital systems.
